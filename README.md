# TriviaGame

The trivia game automatically loads the questions based on a timer.
The user then either selects an answer, or has time expire on them.

If they guess incorrectly, their answer turns red and the correct answer is displayed in green.

At the end of the game, the totals of wins, losses, and timeouts is displayed,
and the game restarts itself.

The trivia information is managed in a separate data.js file.  To use the system for a completely different set of questions, this file can simply be changed out for another file formatted in the same way.
